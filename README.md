# MNJScript
MNJScript/MNJ3 (stands for My Name Jeff) is an interpreter joke programming language. It is written in Python3 and modelled after BASIC.

The only difference is mostly everything begins with JEFF.

## Installation
Download all files and place them into a folder. Then run MNJTerminal.bat to access the command line.

If you are on macOS or any other OS, open the files in Visual Studio Code or something similar, then type "python3 cli.py" to access the terminal.
