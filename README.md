# MNJScript
MNJScript/MNJ3 (stands for My Name Jeff) is an interpreter joke programming language. It is written in Python3 and modelled after BASIC.

The only difference is most commands begin with Jeff.

## Installation
Download all files and place them into a folder. Then run MNJTerminal.bat to access the command line.

### macOS
Install python3 if you havent. Download all files and place them into a folder. Open the terminal and cd to the folder with the files.
Type "python3 cli.py" and the terminal should start.

### Linux
Find it out yourself

## Extra notes
As of now, MNJScript is in early alpha with version 0.0.3 being the 1st version. This means there are alot of bugs.
I can verify it works both on Windows and macOS, with it being developed on macOS.

### Future updates??????
There will be future updates. I am planning to also make an installer and bug fixes.
